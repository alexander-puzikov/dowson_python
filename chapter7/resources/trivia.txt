Computer vision
SIFT algorithm
One main part of SIFT algorithm is:
Chi-square dispersion
Hessian matrix
Difference of Gaussian
Bag of words
3
Difference of Gaussian algorithm computes a pyramid of gaussian with /different scales of gaussian filter
Simple image processing
What does it call when histogram of image brightness is changed in /way when there is all kind of brightness level with close to average value
Histogram maximization
Histogram normalization
Derivety of histogram
Histogram minimization
2
This is normalization, sometimes processed with cumulative distribution function
